# Project-3-CS210
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. This project is to create a grocery inventory tracker. You use a text file to add data into the tracker and prompt for user input.
What did you do particularly well? I called the classes properly and made sure to use the correct private or public class.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? I need to change the backup to open when it is suppose too.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? the cases were the most difficult for me to write, I used overstack to help me understand how to make them run right.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? calling classes seems to be the most transferable
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I ran the code frequently as I wrote it to insure it would run properly, if it didn't run, I would double check the code and rework it to run right.
